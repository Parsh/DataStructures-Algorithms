    "# Introduction to Data Structures\n",
    "Note: For prominent interview questions on Data Structures and Algorithms refer to the E:\\Algorithms and DataStructures\\Python For Data Structures Algorithms and Interviews\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is data structure?\n",
    ">A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data. General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While studying data structures, we talk or study them in 2 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">**1. Mathematical and logical models/ Abstract Data Types/Interface:** <br> \n",
    "Here we just have an abstract view of DS, that studying them from a high level regrading what all features and operations define that particular data structure. \n",
    "Example- When we talk about DS such as a list, while only considering what all features it provide, such as storing data, reading data elements by position, modifying data at a position etc. and not it's implementation,  in such way we give an abstract view of the data type or to say, we provide with the definition of an abstract data type.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Abstract DataTypes (ADTs) defines data and operations, but no implementation. An ADT can be implemented using different Data Structures, for example: a List ADT can be implemented using both an array and linked list data structures.\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the most powerful ideas in computer science. It separates the What from the HOW.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**2. Implementation:** <br>\n",
    "Here we consider the actualization of the mathematical models or the ADTs. This is the HOW for the ADTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note (Time Complexity):** Whenever time complexity is defined for a particular instance of code, it typically describes it's worst case, because we are mostly concerned with the worst case runtime of that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays and the Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing list as an Abstract Data Type (With array implementation):<br> ![](./Images/List-ADT.png \"List ADT and Array Implementaion\")\n",
    "\n",
    "ADTs require memory while implementation. Now, the job of managing the memory, like what part of mem is allocated and which is free etc., is done by the guy called Memory Manager, and we as a programmer talk to him in a high level language like C.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of arrays, while assigning memory (which for instance depends on the type of variable, like for int it's generally 4bytes), the address of the block of memory is the address of the first byte of that memory block, also known as the Base Address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now while creating an array: when we declare the array with the type of variable (references in python list) it holds along with the size of the array and based on these 2 parameters the Memory Manager calculates the size of memory block required, it search for such a block and then allocates it, if found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do accessing any element in an array takes a constant time?\n",
    ">Say, we have an array: int A[4], now corresponding to this array the Memory Manager will find us and allocate a 16byte block of mem with the 1st byte having an address of 201(say, therefore this will be out block address).\n",
    "Now if our program want to access the element A[3], to find it's memory address, the following calculation would be done:\n",
    "<br> **Base Address (201) + index (3) x size of variable (4) = 213** <br>\n",
    "This is the mem address of the A[3] element, so in this way it always take a constant amount of time to access an element in an array, i.e. Time Complexity is O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Array Drawbacks**\n",
    "> \n",
    "- Array always holds a contiguous block of memory, for that very reason, we have to predefine its size because it's a static data structure, and in most scenarios it is not extendable. If we want to increase the size of an array, we have to create a new array for greater size and paste the element from older one to this new one. And as the referencing ends, the old array will be deleted (garbage collection). This all would cost us time, which is why having an array in such a scenario is not an effective choice. \n",
    "- The time complexity for inserting and deleting elements from an array is high O(n), due to the shifting of elements.\n",

    "What is the difference between 32 bit and a 64 bit operating system >> [32bit vs 64bit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-32-bit-64-bit-operating-systems/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python List:\n",
    "\n",
    "If list store heterogeneous elements, than how come it have constant access time, as constant access time/ random access time allows us to randomly access memory addresses in constant time and is computed as: memory address =  start/base_address + (object_size) * (index)   \n",
    "\n",
    "Naive view: Objects have different sizes and list are heterogeneous then memory address calculation would fall apart, hence constant access seems non feasible.\n",
    "Correction: **Python list doesn't store object themselves, they store the object references** which are of same size irrespective of the object they are referring to. Hence, Python lists are Referential Arrays (or array of references).\n",
    "\n",
    "But then what is the size of the python references?  (How much memory taken by variables in python)\n",
    "The size of a reference in Python is the same as the word size for the CPU. So, it's 4 bytes on a 32-bit system, and 8 bytes on a 64-bit system.\n",
    "\n",
    "How are lists implemented?\n",
    ">Python’s lists are really variable-length arrays, not Lisp-style linked lists. The implementation uses a contiguous array of references to other objects, and keeps a pointer to this array and the array’s length in a list head structure.\n",
    "This makes indexing a list  a[i] an operation whose cost is independent of the size of the list or the value of the index.\n",
    "When items are appended or inserted, the array of references is resized. Some cleverness is applied to improve the performance of appending items repeatedly; when the array must be grown, some extra space is allocated so the next few times don’t require an actual resize.\n",
    "\n",
    "How a python list Grows? (Table Doubling (but not exact), non linear growth).\n",
    ">Overview: When the number of elements in the python list are approximately equals the number of elements that the list, of the given size, could hold/ list's capacity. Then we copy the references of this array into a new array which has twice the capacity of the old array (and the old array is deleted by garbage collection) as per the Table Doubling mechanism. \n",

    "## Introduction to linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "Why to use linked list when we do have arrays/list already available? \n",
    ">Because in many scenarios, arrays are not efficient. For instance: while inserting, removing elements or when the array shrinks or grows very quickly (as arrays are of fixed/static type, whose size is predefined, therefore many times we have to copy elements into  a new larger size array so as to accommodate new data elements), in such cases they proves to be very costly in terms of time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked List:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. A linked list consists of Nodes, within each node there is a data field and a pointer field, the data field holds that data element and the pointer field holds the address to the next node of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note (Memory of References):** In Python as the variables are basically object references they consume either 4byte (in 32-bit system) or 8 bytes (in 64-bit system) of the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only detail to be stored about a linked list is the address of its head, which is its first node. From there, every subsequent node can be traced based on the pointer variable of its previous node. Also the address in the pointer variable of the last node is null or zero, which marks the end of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/LinkedList.png \"Linked List\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The above image represents a typcial Linked List data strucuture, however, in python a single node of the linked list (singly) contains two object references: \n",
    "- the object reference to the data type of the attribute which that node object contains.\n",
    "- one to reference the next node object obviously\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LinkedList Benefits:\n",
    ">We can create nodes as and when we want, so don't have to predefine the size. Moreover, Insertion and deletion of nodes is comparatively easy then array, as here we don't have to shift other elements to insert or after deleting a particular data element. In Linked lists, first we copy the address from the pointer variable of the previous index node into that of the this new insertion node and then we just have to change the pointer variable value of the previous index node, so as to hold the address value of the new insertion node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks of LinkedList: \n",
    ">- By using linked list, we may have the comfort generating a dynamic storage. However, we compromise the ability of accessing the elements in constant time i.e. linked list have sequential access of complexity O(n) as compared to random access in arrays of complexity O(1). Here, in order to access an element, we have to first get to the head node, then from there have to use pointers of subsequent nodes, to finally arrive at the nth node, which is what we wanted.\n",
    "- They consume much require much more memory space as compared to arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for Linked List the Time Complexity, in worst case,  for accessing element as well as for insertion and deletion is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array vs Linked List \n",
    "[There is no such thing as one data structure is better than other data structure. It is the  fit of the data structure to your requirements and the complexity it provides corresponding to the operations that you would want to perform frequently, that makes a data structure appropriate or inappropriate for that scenario]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round 1: Access Time**\n",
    "![](./Images/AccessTime.png \"Access Time\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: Array wins, as it takes a constant time (random access) to access an element as compared to a linear time (sequential access) taken by a Linked List.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round 2: Memory requirement**\n",
    "![](./Images/MemoryRequirement2.png \"Memory Requirement\") \n",
    "\n",
    "Result: Linked List wins, as they don't need a single contiguous block of memory (which sometimes for very large arrays isn't possible to get). Moreover, the memory utilization is better in linked lists, no unused memory. And when the size of data element to be stored is bigger (say, 16 byte), in such cases Linked List becomes more effective in using memory space (as compared to  an array with unused space in it).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round 3: Cost of Insertion (same for Deletion)**\n",
    "![](./Images/InsertingElements.png \"Cost of Insertion\") \n",
    "\n",
    "Result: Draw, as both are pretty similar (averaged) in terms of Time complexity while performing an insertion and/or deletion in different scenarios. Insertions/Deletions are fairly simple in Linked list (just correctly setup the pointers) as compared to shifting all the elements in array which takes O(n) but the fact that in order to insert/delete elements in between the linked list we would have traverse it to that point, which will obviously be sequential, makes the insertion/deletion complexity O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round 4: Ease of use and implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: Array wins, as they are pretty simple and are more immune to errors, whereas Linked List in general are more prone to errors like segmentation fault (in C, C++) and therefore need to be carefully implemented.\n",

    "When to use what?\n",
    ">**Linked lists are preferable over arrays when:**\n",
    " - you need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list (such as in real-time computing where time predictability is absolutely critical)\n",
    " - you don't know how many items will be in the list (as Linked lists are dynamic in nature). With arrays, you may need to re-declare and copy memory if the array grows too big \n",
    " - you don't need random access to any elements \n",
    " - you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list (such as a priority queue)\n",
    " \n",
    ">**Arrays are preferable when:**\n",
    " - you need indexed/random access to elements \n",
    " - you know the number of elements in the array ahead of time so that you can allocate the correct amount of memory for the array\n",
    " - you need speed when iterating through all the elements in sequence. You can use pointer math on the array to access each element, whereas you need to lookup the node based on the pointer for each element in linked list, which may result in page faults which may result in performance hits.\n",
    " - memory is a concern. Filled arrays take up less memory than linked lists. Each element in the array is just the data. Each linked list node requires the data as well as one (or more) pointers to the other elements in the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Linked lists:\n",
    " \n",
    ">1. Singly Linked List: These are linked list consisting of Nodes which have two fields, namely: a data field and a pointer(to next Node) field. When we say Linked List, we are mostly talking about these singly linked list. \n",
    "2. Doubly Linked List: These are linked list consisting of Nodes which have three fields, namely: a data field, a pointer field (to the next Node) and another pointer field (to the previous Node).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note (Interview Space):** Reversing a linked list is one of the most prominent interview question being asked.<br>\n",
    "There are 2 approaches to achieve this task, Iterativly or Recursively\n",
    "\n",
    "Why in the world do we need DLL?\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Advantages over singly linked list:**\n",
    "1. A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.\n",
    "2. The delete operation in DLL is more efficient. In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed, that is, we have to maintain 2 pointers, one of the current node and one for the previous. However, in DLL, we can get the previous node using the in-node previous pointer, therefore we don't have to explicitly use a previous pointer in all those cases where we use to in singly linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Disadvantages over singly linked list:**\n",
    "1. Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL with single pointer though.\n",
    "2. All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained, therefore we are more prone to errors while using a doubly linked list. For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. For example in following functions for insertions at different positions, we need 1 or 2 extra steps to set previous pointer.\n",

    "\n",
    "A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base.” \n",
    "\n",
    "The base of the stack is significant since items stored in the stack that are closer to the base represent those that have been in the stack the longest. The most recently added item is the one that is in position to be removed first. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This ordering principle is sometimes called LIFO, last-in first-out.** It provides an ordering based on length of time in the collection. Newer items are near the top, while older items are near the base.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the figure below:\n",
    "![](./Images/StackInAction.png \"Stack in Action\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the first items \"pushed\" to the stack begin at the base, and as items are \"popped\" out. Stacks are fundamentally important, as **they can be used to reverse the order of items**. The order of insertion is the reverse of the order of removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Applications-Stack.png \"Applications\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering this reversal property, you can perhaps think of examples of stacks that occur as you use your computer. For example, every web browser has a Back button. As you navigate from web page to web page, those pages are placed on a stack (actually it is the URLs that are going on the stack). The current page that you are viewing is on the top and the first page you looked at is at the base. If you click on the Back button, you begin to move in reverse order through the pages.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **queue** is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items happens at one end, called the “rear,” and the removal of existing items occurs at the other end, commonly called the “front.” As an element enters the queue it starts at the rear and makes its way toward the front, waiting until that time when it is the next element to be removed.\n",

    "![](./Images/QueueRuntimes.png \"Definition and Runtime of Operations of a Queue\")\n",

    "The most recently added item in the queue must wait at the end of the collection. The item that has been in the collection the longest is at the front. This ordering principle is sometimes called **FIFO, first-in first-out**. It is also known as “first-come first-served.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line. The first person in that line is also the first person to get serviced/helped. \n",

However, as per the Queue ADT, all operations in a queue must take constant time. <br> \n",

What makes a deque different is the unrestrictive nature of adding and removing items. New items can be added at either the front or the rear. Likewise, existing items can be removed from either end. In a sense, this hybrid linear structure provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single data structure. \n",

    "A Tree is a non-linear data structure which is basically used to store hierarchical data. The tree in data structure is inspired by the real world tree but with a little modification which is that here the root is at the top and the leaves at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Trees?\n",
    ">1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, the file system on a computer.  \n",
    "2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays).\n",
    "3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).\n",
    "4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees don’t have an upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.\n",

    "![](./Images/IntroToTrees.png \"Tree Vocabulary\")\n",
    "\n",
    "How we create a tree (overview):\n",
    "\n",
    ">Tree represents nodes connected by edges. It has the following properties.\n",
    "- One node is marked as Root node.\n",
    "- Every node other than the root is associated with one parent node.\n",
    "- Each node can have an arbiatry number of child node.\n",
    "- Nodes with zero child nodes are refered to as leaf nodes.\n",
    "- Child Nodes which shared the same parent are called siblings\n",
    "- A tree of N nodes have N - 1 edges because except the root node all other nodes will have exactly one incoming edge.\n",
    "\n",
    ">We create a tree data structure in python by using the concept of node, which contains a reference for data and two other references, in case of binary trees, for left and right childs. We designate one node as the root node and then add more nodes as child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, tree can be defined as a **recursive data structure**. Tree can be defined recursively as a structure that consists of a distinguished node called root and some sub-trees and the arrangement is such that the root of the tree contains the links to roots of all the sub-trees. And we can move like this recursively till we reach the leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![](./Images/HeightOfNode-Tree.png \"Height of a Node in a Tree\")\n",
    "Note: Leaves have a height of zero and the **height of the tree** is same as the height of the root, i.e., the longest path from the root to a leaf node.\n",

    "Note: There are many more types of trees, however, following are the most significant and prominent ones.\n",

If at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Heap Structure:** Heap  structure is another widely used tree structure with a specific ordering property.  There are two types of heap  - Min heap and Max heap. In a min heap the parent of a node must be smaller than the values of all its children.  Similarly in max heap the parent always have greater value compared to all its children. One common implementation of heap is Binary heap where each parent can have at most two children.\n",

    "**Breath First Traversal:** Traverse breadth wise or level to level (from 0 to h) while visting elements from left to right in a given level. **BFS uses queue data structure to store the nodes in the traversal order.**\n",

    "**Depth First Traversal:** Traverse depth wise. **DFS uses stack data structure, implicit stack during recursive traversal, to store the nodes in the traversal order.**<br> \n",
    "It includes these three (by permuting left, root and right child there could be 6 possible combinations in depth first search, however as per the convention left is always visited first therefore the following 3 became prominent)-\n",
    ">**Inorder:** In case of binary search trees (BST), Inorder traversal gives nodes in non- decreasing order i.e. **sorted list**. It follows following pattern while traversing (Left child , Root , Right Child) . It will first go to the left most of sub tree and than to root node of sub tree and than to right child of sub tree. \n",

    ">**Preorder:** Preorder traversal is used to create a copy of the tree. Preorder traversal is also used to get prefix expression on of an expression tree. It follows following pattern while traversing ( Root , Left child , Right Child) .It will first give root node than go to the left of sub tree and than to right child of sub tree.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Postorder:** Postorder traversal is used to delete the tree. Postorder traversal is also useful to get the postfix expression of an expression tree. It follows following pattern while traversing ( Left child , Right Child , Root) . It will first go to the left most of sub tree and than to right child of sub tree than to root node of sub tree.\n",

    "  \n",
    "  Space complexity [**it is the rate of growth of extra memory used with input size**]: Here in BFS, the queue is the main factor cuz it grows and shrinks as we traverse the tree. So, the amount of extra memory used by queue would be given by the number of nodes currently in the queue. If the tree is a sparse tree(of sorted elements [right align or left align]) then for each element dequeued we have an element enqueued, therefore, space complexity in sparse tree becomes O(1). But, if the tree is dense then at each level the number of enqueued elements doubles and at the last level n/2 elements (considering tree as perfect binary tree) would be in the queue. Hence, in worst case, as well as in average case the space complexity is O(n).\n",

    "  Time complexity: In traversing/processing each node there would be one function call corresponding to each node, when we are actually visting/printing that node, and each function call takes some constant time O(1). So, total runtime is the sum of number of fxn calls which inturn is proportional to the number of nodes and therefore time complexity for dfs-variants is linear O(n). <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Space complexity: Space complexity on a generic level, for dfs, is O(h) where h is the height of the tree. Now, height of the tree in the worst case would be n-1 (left/right aligned sparse tree of sorted list). So, worst case complexity would be O(n) and if the tree is a perfect binary tree or atleast dense enough then the height of the tree will be log(base2) n, where n is number of nodes, and the space complexity in average and best case is O(log n). Therefore, the lesser the height the lower would be the space consumption. \n",
