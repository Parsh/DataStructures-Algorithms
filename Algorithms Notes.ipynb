    ">Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output. Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.\n",

    "**Psuedocode:** Pseudo code is an informal high-level description of the operating principle of an algorithm. It uses the structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. As we know that all programming languages share basic code constructs like loops (for, while), flow-control (if-else), etc. These common constructs can be used, in psuedocode, to write an algorithm.\n",

    "**Categories of algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the data structure point of view, following are some important categories of algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search** − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.\n",
    "- **Insert** − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.\n",
    "- **Update** − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.\n",
    "- **Delete** − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.\n",
    "- **Sort** − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.\n",

    "**Characteristics of an Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all procedures can be called an algorithm. An algorithm should have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Input** − An algorithm should have 0 or more well-defined inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Output** − An algorithm should have 1 or more well-defined outputs, and should match the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Unambiguous** − Algorithm should be clear and unambiguous. Each of its steps (or phases), and their inputs/outputs should be clear and must lead to only one meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Finiteness** − Algorithms must terminate after a finite number of steps, an infinite procedure isn't regarded as an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Feasibility** − Should be feasible with the available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Independent** − An algorithm should have step-by-step directions, which should be independent of any programming code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis of Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency of an algorithm can be analyzed at two different stages:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**A Priori Analysis: ** This is a theoretical analysis of an algorithm i.e. a pre-implementation analysis. Efficiency of an algorithm is measured by performing Asyptotic analysis whereby assuming that all other factors, for example, processor speed, are constant and have no effect on the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**A Posterior Analysis: ** This is an empirical analysis of an algorithm i.e. a post-implementation analysis. The selected algorithm is implemented using programming language. This is then executed on target computer machine. In this analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected.\n",

    "Some algorithms are more efficient than others. We would prefer to chose an efficient algorithm, so it would be nice to have metrics for comparing algorithm efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of an algorithm is a function describing the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the amount of data (inputs) the algorithm must process. Usually there are natural units for the domain and range of this function. There are two main complexity measures of the efficiency of an algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Time complexity** is a function describing the amount of time an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm. \"Time\" can mean the number of memory accesses performed, the number of comparisons between integers, the number of times some inner loop is executed, or some other natural unit related to the amount of real time the algorithm will take. We try to keep this idea of time separate from \"wall clock\" time, since many factors unrelated to the algorithm itself can affect the real time (like the language used, type of computing hardware, proficiency of the programmer, optimization in the compiler, etc.). It turns out that, if we chose the units wisely, all of the other stuff doesn't matter and we can get an independent measure of the efficiency of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Space complexity** is a function describing the amount of memory (space) an algorithm takes in terms of the amount of input to the algorithm. We often speak of \"extra\" memory needed, not counting the memory needed to store the input itself. Again, we use natural (but fixed-length) units to measure this. We can use bytes, but it's easier to use, say, number of integers used, number of fixed-sized structures, etc. In the end, the function we come up with will be independent of the actual number of bytes needed to represent the unit. Space complexity is sometimes ignored because the space used is minimal and/or obvious, but sometimes it becomes as important an issue as time.\n",
    "For example, we might say \"this algorithm takes n2 time,\" where n is the number of items in the input. Or we might say \"this algorithm takes constant extra space,\" because the amount of extra memory needed doesn't vary with the number of items processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both time and space, we are interested in the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm: When n (the number of items of input) goes to infinity, what happens to the performance of the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term analysis of algorithms is used to describe approaches to the study of the performance of algorithms. In this course we will perform the following types of analysis:\n",
    "- the **worst-case runtime complexity** of the algorithm is the function defined by the maximum number of steps taken on any instance of size a.\n",
    "- the **best-case runtime complexity** of the algorithm is the function defined by the minimum number of steps taken on any instance of size a.\n",
    "- the **average case runtime complexity** of the algorithm is the function defined by an average number of steps taken on any instance of size a.\n",
    "- the **amortized runtime complexity** of the algorithm is the function defined by a sequence of operations applied to the input of size a and averaged over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asymptotic Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the most effective way of doint a priori analysis. Notations used in asymptotic analysis are refered to as asymptotic notations. Asymptotic Notations could be regarded as a language that allow us to analyze an algorithm’s running time by identifying its behavior as the input size for the algorithm increases. This is also known as an algorithm’s growth rate. Does the algorithm suddenly become incredibly slow when the input size grows? Does it mostly maintain its quick run time as the input size increases? Asymptotic Notation gives us the ability to answer these questions. <br>\n",

    "Ques: Why do we use Big-O to represent the complexity in most cases and not Big-Omega or Theta? <br>\n",
    "Ans: Because most of the time we are concerned with the worst case complexity of our algorithm, i.e., we want to find out the upper bound for our algorithm which communicates the maximum rate of growth of our algorithm's runtime/space-consumption in terms of growth of the input size.\n",
